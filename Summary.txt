For our SAT solver we built a program capable of processing both minimal and extended encodings.
Our input file (an unsolved puzzle) is first encoded and then fed to the miniSAT executable at the path specified.
The output of the SAT solver is then interpretted and the solution within is pretty printed to the output.
The minimal encoding is done by default, but an extended encoding can be done by providing the -e parameter to the program.
